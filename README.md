# Svelte + TS + Vite + Tailwind CSS

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite and using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This is a demo **TODO** application that stores the todo data locally in the browser using localStorage, todo items can also be easily cleared from browser with a click of a button.

Type new todos with the input box and press Enter Key to add new todo.

Use the Theme button to also switch between the dark and light theme of the app.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## How To Run

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```
